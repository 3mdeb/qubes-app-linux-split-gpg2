# for more advanced setups you can set GNUPG home here. This file will be
# sourced everytime a client connets. To have one home dir per client domain
# you can use:
#export GNUPGHOME="$HOME/gpg-home/$QREXEC_REMOTE_DOMAIN"
# before using this you have to create a gpg home for each client domain in
# ~user/gpg-home/$client_domain where $client_domain is the name of the client
# domain

# this is for debugging purpose only
# EVERYTHING WILL BE LOGGED
# including potentially confidential data/keys/etc.
